Hi all. Looking forward to getting started tomorrow. We'll be here in the chat during the duration of the audit to help answer questions. Livepeer is one of the longest running Ethereum based protocols, having been on chain since early 2018. We'll be auditing an exciting upgrade. More details coming tomorrow üôÇ

And The Livepeer Delta Treasury audit is now live. This protocol upgrade introduces an on chain treasury of LPT tokens to the Livepeer protocol. The treasury will be governed by tokenholders using our custom implementation of the OpenZeppelin Governor Framework in use by many other on chain treasuries. We'll be auditing 1) whether the code introduced to track the voting power on treasury proposals breaks any of the existing stake accounting logic, and 2) whether the treasury proposals, voting, and fund-release process itself is secure or can be exploited. 

The contest is open here: https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-08-livepeer-onchain-treasury-upgrade#top

And here is an introductory video on the contest and protocol: https://lvpr.tv/?v=9ae9krf8q296csr8

@victorges @chase and myself @dob | Livepeer will be available in the chat to answer questions, mainly on US East and Brasilia Standard time. Let's go!

Interesting tidbit: vscode hates this option: export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider, so you may need to run tests in a separate terminal if you're running ubuntu.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[08/31/2023 22:44] victorges
if the separate terminal is too cumbersome you *may* be able to edit the commands on the package.json to include that flag as well like
```
    "test": "NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npx hardhat test",
```
(or even as explicit flags to `npx`, tho not sure if that would work)


[08/31/2023 23:23] orbitalautodev

OK so this is an upgrade that will be re-deployed?


[08/31/2023 23:27] victorges

Team, who are the transcoding providers and what they do?


[09/01/2023 06:29] alymurtazamemon
I got it!

Transcoding is the process of taking a raw video file and reformatting it so that no matter what bandwidth you have - whether 2g or 5g - and no matter what device, you're ensured the most optimal viewing experience.

So transcoding providers provides this service for reward, right team?

Team

Orchestrators and Delegators both will be the Livepeer token (LPT) holders.

The question is why the delegator stack their LPT to orchestrators when he can be orchestrators with same tokens?


[09/01/2023 06:57] alymurtazamemon
Is it for those who do not have resouces to become orchestrators but have LPT?

and the delegators are not experts in transcoding


[09/01/2023 09:33] thedob
Hi. That is correct. Token holding delegators are not experts in transcoding. They probably do not have GPUs nor know how to run nodes 24/7. So they stake towards orchestrators.


[09/01/2023 09:33] thedob
Yes. LPT is inflationary, with new LPT minted each round.

Thank you, one more thing
Imagine I am an Orchestrator. I get paid anyways by the broadcaster, now someone stakes in me. It means I have to share my profit  with the stakeholders in stead of keeping it all for me.  That brings me to - Why should I want stakers? I don't get that?

Not every Orchestrator has the time or expertise to perform their jobs 24/7, due to that there is delegator who will perform this job for them and earn reward share.

What is the point of bondWithHint function ? There no have modifiers , no have checks nothing ..


[09/01/2023 11:08] ivand5690
I actually read it, that is why it led me to confusion.
It says: "LPT is required to perform the work of transcoding and distributing video on the network"
Indeed-  Orchestrator should be available 24/7 and token holder (Take a look at Livepeer token section)
However if you are not 24/7 available but you have tokens then you become a Delegator or Staker.


[09/01/2023 11:19] alymurtazamemon
I think you are misunderstanding it. please read it again


[09/01/2023 11:26] alymurtazamemon
Orchestrators are the transcoding service providers (node operators) they have the CPU power and other resources. They need LTP in order to become a node operator.

Now, after becoming an orchestrator, if they cannot manage time to run this service 24/7 (or they have the less technical knowledge), they can select the delegators who will deposit the LTP into their stake and use their resources.

The total reward will be distributed between the orchestrator and the delegator. The orchestrator will be rewarded for providing the resources and the delegator will be awarded for his service (expertise and time).


[09/01/2023 11:36] proxy1967
Delegators only delegate or stake LPT to Orchestrators, they do not perform the orchestrators job for them

[09/01/2023 11:37] proxy1967
The more LPT tokens Orchestrators have, the more they earn fees, and delegetros with them

{Reactions}
üëç 

[09/01/2023 11:45] ivand5690
This is how I also understand it. Delegators are just stakers who deposit their tokens to the Orchestrators. But the Orchestrators are the ones who provide their resources. If you are a delegator you need to choose an Orchestrator which is trustful and available so that you earn fees from their work.

In Summary, if you have Resources but no money, you can¬¥t become Orchestrator, that is why you borrow from the delegators. At least this is how I understand it, however the "Delegator" word is a bit misleading I assume they should be called just Stakers.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[09/01/2023 11:49] alymurtazamemon
Due to this part I thought that delegators will do these things for them.

But yes you can be right also, let's wait for the team to confirm.

[09/01/2023 11:50] alymurtazamemon
But I think this will not effect out audit because others things are similar.


[09/01/2023 12:00] ivand5690
That is the what causes the confusion:
It is assumed that every token holder is an Orchestrator if it can provide Resources.
If you are token holder who doesn't have resources or can't provide 24/7, you are just Delegator or just token provider.
If you want to make money on Livepeer, you don't only need resources but LPT as well.

[09/01/2023 12:25] thedob
Hi. 

1) Yes the Primer is actually a great resource to get an overview of the roles in the protocol. I suggest spending 10 minutes to flip through it. https://livepeer.org/primer

2) Why would orchestrators (O‚Äôs) want to attract more stake from delegators (D‚Äôs)? More stake means that more work will get routes towards them, and hence they can earn more of the ETH fees paid by broadcasters. They also keep a commission on the rewards that their delegators earn in LPT through the reward cut param. If they don‚Äôt want to attract delegator stake they can set their reward cut to 100% and their fee cut to 100% and then no D would want to stake towards them.

[09/01/2023 13:15] ivand5690
Thanks for the reply. How is the workload calculated then?
Let's assume -> I am an Orchestrator 1 with Resources X (which I use at almost 100% )and Stake 1000LPT
Another Orchestrator 2 comes with same Resources X just like me, but bigger stake 10 000LPT 
Does it mean Orchestrator 2 will get more work than me, because his stake is bigger?
How can he manage to execute this extra work when both our Resources (X) are at 100% capacity, he will need to buy more computing power?


[09/01/2023 13:20] thedob
Great questions. The amount of stake is one input into an off chain work selection algorithm. So it is not protocol enforced. Stake represents security, in that it can theoretically be slashed for provably malicious transcoding (though that‚Äôs also not enabled in the protocol yet). Hence broadcasters would prefer to route work towards nodes with more to lose by cheating. 

Regarding capacity, it actually is more like a right of first refusal. More stake means you‚Äôll be selected to begin performing video transcoding on a stream, but if you can‚Äôt keep up then another node will be selected.


[09/01/2023 13:20] thedob
Again, that work selection algorithm is off chain, varies from client to client, and is outside of the scope of the protocol and audit.

[09/02/2023 08:29] thedob
I have seen a few questions come through about the Verifier role, and whether it is trusted. 

Only the registered "Verifier" in the Controller contract can call the slashTranscoder function. The registered verifier contract is 0x0000000000.... the null address. Hence it can't be invoked right now, as slashing is not active in the protocol.

[09/03/2023 10:51] thedob
It‚Äôs a setter for the parameter which can only be called externally by the smart contract that owns the controller. In the current case, that is a security comittee multisig which reacts to governance votes to move that parameter value.

Does the `block.number` and `block.timestamp` match the epoch.
Example: `block.number` is increased by 1 every ~22H (or how long the epoch is).


[09/04/2023 06:27] proxy1967
What's the difference between `Delegator.bondedAmount` and `Delegator.delegatedAmount` ?


[09/04/2023 11:48] thedob
No, the round number is just derived from the Arbitrum block number. You can see the method for computing the current round in the RoundsManager.sol `function currentRound()`


[09/04/2023 11:49] thedob
I believe `bondedAmount` is the self bonded tokens. `delegatedAmount` is the total amount delegated towards this delegator from both themselves, and from other accounts who have staked towards them.

hey, I have trouble understending `uint256 public quota;`. If quota is 4%, then `quota = 4e4`, is that correct?


[09/04/2023 21:33] victorges
Correct. 50% would be 5e5, 100% would be 1e6

hey! the ae2b202 commit is "absolute", it contains all the changes in the upgrade and doesn't need to be diffed with another commit other than its parent

it might've been just a broken link on the place where you found that one. I see that on the readme we don't have any #diff in the url tho


[09/05/2023 19:37] thedob
Hi all. 24 Hours to Go in this contest! We've gotten lots of great questions on stake accounting logic, the relationship beween Transcoders and Delegators, and reward and fee calculation. But we haven't seen as many questions on the treasury. It would be great to get some eyes on the stake checkpointing logic, voting power calculation and vote counting logic on proposals to the `LivepeerGovernor`.

@dob | Livepeer  on which basis new round is updated is it based on some time period  or some call   ?
 Quick Qs.


[09/06/2023 18:21] thedob
It‚Äôs based on math based on the Arbitrum block number.


[09/06/2023 18:22] thedob
And then when a new round begins someone has to call initializeRound


[09/06/2023 18:27] thedob
Correct

[09/06/2023 19:04] victorges
6 digits (`MathUtils`)


[09/06/2023 19:05] 0x11singh99
and rewardcut rate is 27 digits precision ?


[09/06/2023 19:05] victorges
treasuryRewardCutRate is 27-digit

both these represents % number Or actual  value after percent calculation ?


[09/06/2023 19:13] victorges
they are a percentage. the fraction could be represented as `X / 1000000`. this is what we effectively multiply things by when using either of those cut/share values

Im auditing another Code4rena project called "delegate" atm


[09/08/2023 22:18] Banditx0x#5323
In their codebase "delegate" means the person delegating, while in this codebase "delegate" means the person being delegated to


[09/09/2023 03:10] uncle Jeff#4407

[09/09/2023 14:56] Banditx0x#5323
We should have a standard where delegate = verb/action, delegatee = person being delegated to, delegator = person delegating
